# is426 Project: Particulate Matter 2.5 analysis based on Weather Conditions in the NorthEastern United States 

## Objective Overview 
The intent of this project is to explore and visualize the correlation between weather and particulate matter 2.5 in certain counties in the northeast. 

## Data Set Descriptions
### Particulate Matter Dataset  https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-PM2-5-Concentrations-All-County-2001-2016/7vdq-ztk9

This data includes average,highest and lowest pm concentrations for each fpis code in the country from 2001 through 2016. Taken from the CDC data website.

### Weather Data - https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search

Select historical weather data per reporting station for a seleceted time period, granularity of data will be daily for this project

### FPIS Codes - https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2020/demo/popest/2020-fips.html

Excel document which provides FIPS codes to be joined with CDC data to convert data into understandable locations.

## Assumptions 

Data from the most recent year in the dataset 2016 is the most relevant, and will be used for analysis

Breakdown for both Weather data and Particulate matter will be broken down daily

Average daily PM2.5 is used to measure PM for each date

Certain Counties will be selected and explored individually, some with more population than other. 
Initial county selections before looking at data- St. Lawrence County, Kings County

## Data processing steps
filter PM2.5 data to 2016, select rows of fpis state, fpis county, average PM2.5

Join with fpis data, filter by selected counties of intrest

determine stations in each county to determine weather, pull data from website and join with filtered PM data

possibly summarize average weather and average PM by month -determine and calculate relevant summary statistics (average temp, proportion of days with rain, etc)

pass to pandas dataframe for visualization purposes

## Results/Findings
Currently Working through Project
